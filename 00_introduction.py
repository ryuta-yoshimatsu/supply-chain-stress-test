# MAGIC # Stress Test Supply Chain Networks at Scale
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Recent disruptions have highlighted the inherent fragility of global supply chains, challenging the efficiency and reliability of traditional operating models. In response, companies have adopted strategies such as reshoring production and stockpiling essential materials. While these measures aim to improve continuity, they often lead to increased costs and heightened financial risk. To better anticipate and manage such risks, a well-cited [research paper](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/101782) proposes stress testing supply chains using digital twinsâ€”virtual models constructed from real operational data. By simulating a range of disruption scenarios, businesses can uncover vulnerabilities, evaluate potential impacts, and make informed, proactive decisions. This approach is increasingly being adopted to enhance supply chain resilience.
