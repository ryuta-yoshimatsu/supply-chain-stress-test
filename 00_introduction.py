# MAGIC # Stress Test Supply Chain Networks at Scale
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Numerous past disruptions have exposed the fragility of global supply chains, challenging the efficiency and reliability of traditional operating models. In response, companies have adopted strategies such as reshoring production and stockpiling critical materials. While these measures aim to improve continuity, they often result in higher costs and increased financial risk. To better anticipate and manage such challenges, a well-cited [paper](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/101782) proposes stress testing supply chains using digital twinsâ€”virtual models built from real operational data. By simulating a range of disruption scenarios, businesses can identify vulnerabilities, assess potential impacts, and make informed, proactive decisions. This approach is gaining traction as a means to strengthen supply chain resilience.
