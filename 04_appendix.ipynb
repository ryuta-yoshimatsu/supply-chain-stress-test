    "\n",
    "The multi-tier time-to-recover (TTR) model represents a supply chain as a directed graph of materials and production sites. For a disruption lasting t, it selects production quantities (u), inter-tier flows (y), and lost demand (l) to minimize the total weighted loss across all finished products.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints**:\n",
    "1. A bill-of-materials constraint limits each nodeâ€™s output based on the most constrained upstream material.\n",
    "2. A flow-balance constraint caps shipments by available on-hand inventory plus new production.\n",
    "3. Disrupted nodes are assumed to produce nothing during the recovery period.\n",
    "4. Cumulative demand must be met by production and inventory, with unmet demand recorded as loss.\n",
    "5. Plant throughput is limited by production capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting linear program remains computationally tractable even for supply chains with thousands of nodes."

    "The multi-tier time-to-survive (TTS) model asks: given a disruption at a specific node, how long can the network continue meeting demand with no lost sales? It employs the same directed-graph representation as the TTR model, but its linear program maximises the survival horizon, t, rather than minimising lost profit.\n",

    "\n",
    "In both the TTR and TTS models, we simplify by assuming that processing lead times are negligible compared to the disruption's impact. We further assume that the costs associated with rerouting materials and manufacturing changeovers are also negligible relative to the disruption's effect. These assumptions are often reasonable in the context of high-impact disruptions, where their effects far outweigh those of these secondary factors. See the [paper](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/101782) for more details."
